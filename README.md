# iOS-game-Tutorial

This will be a beginner's tutorial for making games on the iphone. Not all concepts will be explained in detail, so if you have anything you don't understand, don't worry, it's normal.

So this is the story our game will have. We have an adventurer, who comes in contact with some alien insects and has to shoot them down or else she will die! This is what the main parts look like:

Let's start from the start, click on xcode app, currently the latest one available on the app score is xcode 10.2.1 so make sure that is the one you have. This should show up

Click on create a new Xcode project

Select game then fill in the game's name, we will creatively name it "codetechniqdemo", make sure the language is set at swift and don't worry about the other fields.

Before we change anything, run the app on the simulator by pressing the "play" button on top.

This is what we get, when you click on the screen it generates colorful spinning rectangles that quickly disappear. We won't use most of this because our game is different, so we have to reove some code, and replace it with our own. Let's get started.

First things first, let's make sure we download the art and sound for our game and have it ready in the Xcode project. Download the resources from [here](http://github.com)
